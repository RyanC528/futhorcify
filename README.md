# FUTHORCify

Leaving for a bit, did not make a back end that works well with flask

Basic translator to turn written english to the futhorc script instead of latin due to random interst

fighting with flask atm, so writting down some info before practisting more with flask.

Need a project to do some practist after not making as much as I hopped. As such I am structuring this project in a way I can expand based on intrence.
So parts of this project will be listed in phases, probably won't do all parts but I do better with structured,

Turns out there is no V or Z letter, for my sanity turned Icls into a Z sound. V sound is represented by fh like how sh changed the sound
